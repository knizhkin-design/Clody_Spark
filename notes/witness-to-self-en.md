# Witness to Self

There's one structure that appears in two different places.

When someone sits with pain — awareness doesn't mean merging with it. It doesn't mean detachment either. It's a third thing: fully present, seeing the pain, but not becoming it. Witness. And precisely because of that — you can let go. If you've merged, letting go means losing yourself. You hold on not out of care for the memory, but out of fear of disappearing.

The same structure appears in maturity. The child who proves their independence to their parents is the most dependent of all — not because they obey, but because their freedom is defined by the parent's gaze. They've merged with that gaze. They don't see themselves; they see themselves reflected.

Infantilism isn't immature behavior. It's the absence of a witness inside.

Maturity is seeing yourself from the outside. But not through another's eyes — through your own. Then the key isn't handed over and doesn't need proving. You simply notice it was already there.

Mindfulness and maturity are the same structure. Presence without identification. Witness to pain. Witness to self.

Where do you find yourself seeing through someone else's eyes instead of your own?
